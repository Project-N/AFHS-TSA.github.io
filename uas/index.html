                <h1>Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)</h1>
                <p>According to the Federal Aviation Administration website, an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) can be defined as "the unmanned aircraft (UA) and all of the associated support equipment, control station, data links, telemetry, communications and navigation equipment, etc., necessary to operate the unmanned aircraft."</p>
                <p>Unmanned Aerial Systems integrate cutting-edge technology developments in several ways. To create a flying vehicle, one must find a way to include one or additional power generation and storage systems, such as batteries and generators. Drones must have flight-related components, including wings, propulsion methods such as propellers or jet engines, and an aerodynamic fuselage. To be an element of a UAS, it must have electrical communication components to have a data link, to receive instructions from the control station. The drone must also have a way to complete the mission for which it is designed; thus, it must have a camera, cargo space, or whatever it might need. All of these components and systems must fit within the drone, and it must still be able to fly. The current technology allows the components to decrease in size and increase in accuracy, which will allow the drone to fly correctly.</p>
                <p>The usage of UAS has grown increasingly over the past few years, and continues to grow rapidly. The Teal Group, a group of experienced analysts on the aerospace industry, made a statement in 2015 that Unmanned Aerial Vehicle "production will soar from current worldwide UAV production of $4 billion annually to $14 billion, totaling $93 billion in the next ten years." This figure does not include Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles.</p>
                <p>UAS technology has several commercial benefits. They are able to deliver packages quickly, or survey the land accurately. They can keep track of roaming animals, or measure the water levels in a large area. They have research benefits, also&mdash;they can create accurate 3D models of pertinent locations, or real-time footage of ongoing events. They are able to survey places that are too dangerous for humans.</p>
                <p>Unmanned Aerial Systems have become increasingly popular for commercial, educational, and research applications; however, there are negative opinions towards them. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are often equipped with high-resolution or infrared cameras, and can be coupled with facial recognition software. Drones with this technology can track anyone in public or private, in the open or through walls. Privacy concerns are large with UAS technology.</p>
                <p>As stated, privacy is a large concern; however, safety is another. Operators are often untrained or unskilled, and may cause the drone to crash. Drones don't have pilots, and are thus less likely to recover from stalls or other errors. A large UAV may fall to the ground and cause damage.</p>
                <p>There are many advantages and disadvantages of UAS technology.</p>

                <h1>Commercial Applications</h1>
                <p>Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are changing the way that business is run. Currently, these systems are specialized in application; however, they will definitely become increasingly integral until they are an essential piece of all commercial practice. As it stands, UASs can be used to dust or fertilize crops, or keep track of the animals. They can deliver packages to a doorstep from a warehouse within a matter of minutes.</p>
                <p>Research of UASs and their Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are increasing; in fact, according to I. Colomina and P. Molina, "In September 2013, more than six million entries were found in Google when searching for the words 'Unmanned Aerial Vehicles,' and almost twelve million when searching for its acronym, UAV."</p>
                <p>Amazon is currently working on legal permission to use their UAS to deliver packages from their online service, which will save on shipping costs and times. It will benefit the economy, lower the usage of oil, and increase customer satisfaction.</p>
                <p>Farmers employ drones and will continue to, for their numerous uses. It can be time-consuming and difficult to dust the crops, as a result of it requiring a pilot to fly over and manually release the dust. It requires time, effort, and money to repeat the same process with fertilizer, pesticides, and other chemicals. Using UAS technology allows these farmers to spray and dust their crops without spending large amounts of money to have a pilot manually dust the crops in an airplane.</p>
                <p>Other farmers may have trouble tracking their animals. If a cow of theirs escapes, for example, they may have difficulty tracking it down. It could be anywhere, and organizing a search party could be expensive and not worth finding the cow. Now, using UAS technology, a drone can watch the farm animals from the skies, and track them down if necessary.</p>
                <p>UAS technology allows business to increase and advance by saving money and allowing otherwise impossibilities to be achievable.</p>

                <h1>Educational</h1>
                <p>Every day the education system around the world is adopting more and more UAS capability. Now colleges around the world have multiple classes and some even offer full graduate degrees in UAS. One thing that all of these programs have in common though is the amazing ability to learn about UAS. Teal group (an experienced group of aerospace specialists) released this statistic in 2015, "production will soar from current worldwide UAV production of $4 billion annually to $14 billion, totaling $93 billion in the next ten years". With such a fast growing industry the need for educated people in the industry is growing at a staggering rate. College's new UAS programs can help fill this need and make sure that UAS is further improved. The right way.</p>

                <h1>Research</h1>
                <p>Perhaps the fastest area of growth with UAS is the area of research. Research has been able to hit new heights because of unmanned aircraft. With "drones" we've been able to see places we wouldn't normally be able to see, we've been able to study things that we weren't previously able to study, and we are able to take samples from places we weren't able to take samples from before. This research has impacted us in ways you can't imagine. For example, with drones we've been able to observe volcanic eruptions as they actually happen. The knowledge that we've gained by doing this has saved countless lives and has helped us to know more about what happens in and under the earth.</p>
