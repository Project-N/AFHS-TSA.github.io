                <h1>Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)</h1>
                <p>According to the Federal Aviation Administration website, an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) can be defined as "the unmanned aircraft (UA) and all of the associated support equipment, control station, data links, telemetry, communications and navigation equipment, etc., necessary to operate the unmanned aircraft."</p>
                <p>Unmanned Aerial Systems integrate cutting-edge technology developments in several ways. To create a flying vehicle, one must find a way to include one or additional power generation and storage systems, such as batteries and generators. Drones must have flight-related components, including wings, propulsion methods such as propellers or jet engines, and an aerodynamic fuselage. To be an element of a UAS, it must have electrical communication components to have a data link, to receive instructions from the control station. The drone must also have a way to complete the mission for which it is designed; thus, it must have a camera, cargo space, or whatever it might need. All of these components and systems must fit within the drone, and it must still be able to fly. The current technology allows the components to decrease in size and increase in accuracy, which will allow the drone to fly correctly.</p>
                <p>The usage of UAS has grown increasingly over the past few years, and continues to grow rapidly. The Teal Group, a group of experienced analysts on the aerospace industry, made a statement in 2015 that Unmanned Aerial Vehicle "production will soar from current worldwide UAV production of $4 billion annually to $14 billion, totaling $93 billion in the next ten years." This figure does not include Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles.</p>
                <p>UAS technology has several commercial benefits. They are able to deliver packages quickly, or survey the land accurately. They can keep track of roaming animals, or measure the water levels in a large area. They have research benefits, also&mdash;they can create accurate 3D models of pertinent locations, or real-time footage of ongoing events. They are able to survey places that are too dangerous for humans.</p>
                <p>Unmanned Aerial Systems have become increasingly popular for commercial, educational, and research applications; however, there are negative opinions towards them. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are often equipped with high-resolution or infrared cameras, and can be coupled with facial recognition software. Drones with this technology can track anyone in public or private, in the open or through walls. Privacy concerns are large with UAS technology.</p>
                <p>As stated, privacy is a large concern; however, safety is another. Operators are often untrained or unskilled, and may cause the drone to crash. Drones don't have pilots, and are thus less likely to recover from stalls or other errors. A large UAV may fall to the ground and cause damage.</p>
                <p>There are many advantages and disadvantages of UAS technology.</p>

                <h1>Commercial</h1>
                <p>UAS has many commercial uses, not all of which are evident. One of the most common uses that have been researched is using UAS's to deliver packages. Amazon is currently researching this technology as well as other large businesses. Another use of UAS's is for filming. Footage can be captured from angles that were not previously possible to film. Some television channels have even started broadcasting sporting event footage from drones.</p>
                <h2>Agriculture Uses</h2>
                <p>UAS's can be used to monitor crops during the growing season. They can be used to analyse acres of crops faster than humans and can see problems that cannot be seen with the human eye through NDVI. These same drones can also inspect irrigation equipment, find weeds, find out how much fertilizer certain crops need, and monitor herds of cattle.</p>
